# TorMail üßÖ

**TorMail** is an experimental, ephemeral Tor hidden-service mail system built with Flask, GNUPG, and Stem. It‚Äôs designed for private, temporary communication where:

‚úÖ All messages are **end-to-end encrypted** using GPG  
‚úÖ User identities exist only as ephemeral GPG keys  
‚úÖ Messages live purely **in-memory**, leaving no disk traces  
‚úÖ Access happens only through a Tor hidden service  

---

## üîê How It Works

- **Ephemeral Tor Hidden Service**  
    Launches a unique `.onion` address on startup, forwarding traffic to the Flask app.

- **User Accounts**  
    Users generate GPG key pairs tied to `<username>@tormail.onion`, protected by a private passphrase.

- **Authentication**  
    Users decrypt a test message during login to prove key ownership.

- **Messaging**  
    - All messages are GPG-encrypted.  
    - Stored in RAM only while the server is running.  
    - Decrypted only on demand via user sessions.

- **Security Features**  
    - Strict Content Security Policy  
    - Rate-limiting on all endpoints  
    - Randomized HTTP headers to disguise the server fingerprint

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Warnings

- **No persistence.** Messages vanish if the server restarts.
- Not production-grade ‚Äî research use only.
- Requires Tor Browser or a SOCKS5 proxy to access the hidden service.

## üöÄ Future Development Goals

![Uploading ComingSoon.png‚Ä¶]()

TorMail is evolving. Future versions aim to:

- **Implement offline message storage:**
    - Store encrypted mail on an OpenLog SD card module.
    - Operate the SD card with selective hardware isolation:
        - Disable RX/TX lines to physically prevent data exfiltration or tampering.
    - Keep keys and decrypted content out of persistent storage entirely.

- **Enhance security:**
    - Stronger session management.
    - Client-side crypto for additional secrecy.
    - Hardened endpoints and input validation.

- **Improve UX:**
    - Richer HTML templates for inbox and mail composition.
    - Per-message decryption on demand.
    - Optional vanity `.onion` addresses.
